# ContrastiveMemory-Exp
Code for Falk*, Strupp*, et al. "Contrastive learning through non-equilibrium memory", to generate results in Fig. 3 (training an energy-based model to perform MNIST classification) .

Code is a lightly modified version of Ben Scellier's [Equilibrium Propagation codebase](https://github.com/bscellier/Towards-a-Biologically-Plausible-Backprop), which is written in [Theano](https://pypi.org/project/Theano/) (v1.0.5) with some auxillary Python (v2.7).
